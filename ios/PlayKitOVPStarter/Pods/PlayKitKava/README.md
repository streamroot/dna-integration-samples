# PlayKit Kava Plugin

This project is the new client analytics project of Kaltura.

With Kava project, Kaltura real time analytics for live and on-demand video, you'll get historical or near real-time, raw or summarized data Kaltura partners need to truly understand how, when, and where their content is seen and shared by viewers.
